Cryptocurrency that represents something

Bitcoin is often criticised by sceptics for having no intrinsic value. Could it be that the real value of Bitcoin is that it has exposed a fact that has been largely hidden from public view for many years? The fact that traditional forms of money such as US Dollars, Euros and Yen have no more intrinsic value than Bitcoin!

The aim of this project is to create a currency that represents something. Something real and valuable. That something is the entirety of the Earth's resources - water, oil, rain forests, farm land, fish stocks, iron, aluminium, ozone ...

"Ownership" of the Earth's resources is concentrated in the hands of a shrinking number of individuals and organizations. The Earth's inhabitants consume these resources in grossly unequal proportion according to arbitrary criteria such as place of birth and parentage. But can anyone claim an intrinsic right to ownership of the Earth's resources? 

This project aims to create a currency and an accounting system to enable the more equal distribution of the benefits of Earth's resources between all the Earth's inhabitants, currently living and yet to be born.

This is not a Communist inspired plot. Although it must be acknowledged that "ownership" of everything has almost invariably been acquired by violence of one kind or another, it must also be recognised that it is not practical for the Earth's resources to be communally owned and centrally controlled. The aim of this project is not to redistribute the control of "owned" resources but rather redistribute the benefits of ownership without cost to the current "owners".
